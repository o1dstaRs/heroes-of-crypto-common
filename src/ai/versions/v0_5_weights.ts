/**
 * Learned weights for v0.5's self-play-trained evaluator.
 *
 * v0.5 is the first REINFORCEMENT-LEARNED AI version: rather than hand-tuned thresholds, its scoring
 * coefficients are searched by self-play (the Cross-Entropy Method, src/simulation/optimizer/cem.mjs)
 * against a FROZEN v0.4. The engine has no board-state clone/rollback (so no lookahead / MCTS is
 * possible — verified), which makes black-box POLICY SEARCH over a parameterised scorer the right RL
 * family here; reward is simply the self-play decisive win rate.
 *
 * The DEFAULT vector below reproduces v0.4's shot scoring EXACTLY (so an untrained v0.5 == v0.4):
 *   - enemy hit: value += shotDamage * effective   (v0.4: += effective, i.e. 1.0)
 *   - enemy RANGE hit additionally: += shotRange * effective  (v0.4: total 2.0x, so default shotRange=1.0)
 *   - friendly-fire splash: value -= shotFriendlyFire * effective  (v0.4: -= effective, i.e. 1.0)
 *   - shotKill / shotFirepower / shotLevel: NEW biases, default 0 (off) so the default is a no-op delta.
 * CEM searches around this and writes the winning vector back here.
 *
 * Runtime injection: the strategy reads `process.env.V05_WEIGHTS` (a JSON number[]) when present — this
 * is how the CEM harness evaluates a candidate vector inside the tournament workers. It is NEVER read
 * from disk (no readFileSync) so the browser client bundle is unaffected; the committed default below
 * is the shipped behaviour.
 */

    "shotDamage", // * expected effective damage on an enemy hit (proven dominant term)
    "shotKill", // * cumulative HP of a stack THIS shot finishes (focus-kill bonus)

    "shotFirepower", // * target firepower / 1000 (prefer silencing high-DPS shooters)
